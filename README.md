# Aircraft-Landing-Gear-Design
I recently worked on designing aircraft landing gear, focusing on both performance and appearance. For materials, I chose strong, lightweight options like titanium, aluminum, and steel to ensure durability under extreme loads. As for color, finishes like matte black and metallic silver were selected for their visual appeal and practical benefits like visibility. Using CAD, I separated material properties for simulations and color properties for design aesthetics, ensuring both functionality and style were achieved. This project highlighted the importance of balancing engineering and aesthetics in design.
